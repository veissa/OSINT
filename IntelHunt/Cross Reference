Here are the letters corresponding to each ASCII value you provided:


    73 -> I
    110 -> n
    116 -> t
    101 -> e
    108 -> l
    72 -> H
    117 -> u
    110 -> n
    116 -> t
    123 -> {
    65 -> A
    49 -> 1
    119 -> w
    52 -> 4
    89 -> Y

As for the second part, I sadly couldn't find it up to now, I found his snapchat as we will see later on, but couldn't find this second part yet.
